# Security-breach
Ethical hacking project

This project is for educational purposes only and I 
do not support the use of this information for malicious purposes. 
In order to avoid misunderstandings, the target device is my
personal computer, and the stolen information does not contain 
personal data, or sensitive information that could endanger me.

Server.py - on the attack computer listening for connections
Client.py + Setup.py + cx_Freeze module => client.exe - this is for the target computer

For the cx_Freeze there are youtube tutorials

data.bat - Collects data about the device
email.bat - Sends email via command line with the files collected by data.bat
